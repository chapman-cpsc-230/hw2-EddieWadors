## Description

Used while loops to find the cooling temperature of a cup of tea in air and used while loops to run sum of powers equations and factorial equations in class as well.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to use a while loop effectively to run a certain equation or print command until it reaches the desired number. 

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
